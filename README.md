# infl_v_unemp

A few days ago, Krugman made a seemingly off-handed remark in his NYTimes
opinion piece that unemployment and inflation are unrelated.  We become educated
primarily to overcome false intuition.  Krugman's statement seemed counter-
intuitive, so I went looking for some data.  He just might have been right,
but as usual in economics there are hints that he was wrong.  Look around and
make up your own mind on the "Inflation vs Unemployment" issue.
